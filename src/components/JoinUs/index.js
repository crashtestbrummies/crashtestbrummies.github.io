We are always on the look out for new members, from people who have never skated before to already established skaters looking for a league in the West Midlands.

Keep an eye on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CrashTestBrummies/) for upcoming events and intakes or [get in touch with us](http://m.me/CrashTestBrummies/).

Already a derby skater? No worries!! We have an open door policy that is Open To All derby skaters â€“ just turn up and get stuck in! The only exception to this is if we have an organised game against your league announced (sorry).
